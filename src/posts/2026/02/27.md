I've done some slight color updates to the blog, it's small stuff but it feels nicer to look at now.
Today has been just fine, mostly rotting in my room and consuming media, it feels sluggish but meh I guess
for now it's okay but I wanna get to work on something that matters to other people, not some sort of circlejerk
online thing that just helps reinforce your worldview but something that people actually dont expect and that are
fascinated by It's just so hard to come up with innovative ideas with the **conditions** I have, it'd be like just 
rewriting the same thing over and over and over and over, my hobbies are small and I dont know what I can help with,
something that can stick to me and that can bring actual change in the environment around me even if by a small bit.
I could resort to begging others to find stuff for me to do but it would be so humiliating for me.

Youtube keeps asking "are you experiencing interruptions find out why!" bitch I know it's something to do with me 
using brave browser and adblockers I just can't prove it, greedy fucking cunts I do not care about giving you money
every single creator nowdays has even more ads for shit like **NordVpn** ( hot steaming garbage, just use **Mullvad** )

Today has been all from me
