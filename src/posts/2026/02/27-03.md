# The Wonder child

I was supposed to be the **wonder child**, the one to make a difference in my family, the one who was 
gonna get a cushy job out of a family of immigrants and manual labourers. Sadly not all things go the
way they're supposed to, burnout, pain, mental struggle all of these killed all the dreams that people 
had for me, I was meant to be the smart one the one was good at computers and knew how to get his way
but at the end of the day I flunked out, life simply wasn't meant to be for me. I spent years agonizing
because of other people's expectations for me, and I regret it oh so deeply, I should've just done my own 
thing from the start instead of being a foolish child who didn't know better.

&nbsp;  

Y'know, I could totally live off of nothing, if money wasn't a problem I would just be in my room 
writing my silly things consuming my silly media and living a moderately average life until my death,
and I would be content with all of it, these human ambitions and strives I simply do not understand
they aren't made for me, everyone seeks all of this complex self actualization while mine is to simply
relax and lay in my bed or chair observing the world around me. The stars are truly beautiful, I wish I
was swimming among them instead of this goddamn piece of dirt that we call a planet, the universe was made
for me to explore and float in, not for this pathetic spectacle of daily nothingness that I experience daily.
I love the infinity of space and I wish I was there to explore more of it, but alas I was born at the wrong 
time and in the wrong place, the lazy ones, the **hikkikomori**, I might be one myself but I take no shame in 
it, the calm and peaceful living might not be so bad after all I just wish I didn't have so many expectations 
to meet, get a job get a wife have some kids meet people pretend that you connect with them, the best moments 
of my life were when I was drooling during a massive acid trip laying on my bed becoming one with everything or
when I first overdosed and ended up in the psych ward (when I was passed out not when I woke up), I miss it, I
truly and honestly miss it, being dead n passed out, floating among the stars in the nothingness of the void.

**That was the day I fell in love with non-existing**

&nbsp;

I feel floaty, like my reality is slowly unraveling, layer by layer I am becoming one with myself, my true
emotions and feelings coming out, I wish every day could feel like that last one for me, because damn I need
a break from having to think about tomorrow all the time.
