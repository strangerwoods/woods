You wake up surrounded by people you dont care about you, neither do you of them of course
but in this big game of play pretend you lie as naturally as you breathe and face them with 
a thousand different smiles and pleasanteries, it has been happening so often that it has become 
the norm, your life, your death, but in the end when the party ends and everyone leaves you sigh
a breath of relief - you can stop pretending now, there's nothing else that needs to be done, you faked
long enough and you've been rewarded with a few hours of silence and peace.  

&nbsp;

The cycle will begin again ventually and you stop to think if it's worth it in the first place, do these people
matter enough to put in the effort to present yourself as a sane individual, as one who has any interest in what's
going on around them or in the lives of those nearby, do you ever truly feel like yourself when faced with another
moving slab of meat? I wonder if this room would be better if everyone was in the brink of dying, or their lives 
getting ruined, would you at least feel better in knowing that everyone is showing their true face for once in their
life? If the world was about to end at any second now, would it allow everyone to feel more at peace with themselves
and honest.

&nbsp;

I can confidentely say that I have suffered much more coming into this little game of existence that everyone else
seems to enjoy oh so much, I do not wish to go out pretending that I'm okay, that indulging in the common **bullshit**
that everyone does pleases me, I despise the *human experience* in all of it's aspects, I was born striving for more 
but no such thing is present on this planet, maybe not even in this universe, my drugs of choice have at least gotten
me close to some kind of understanding or closure on what all of this is meant to be.

&nbsp;

I support **anyone** and **anything** who wishes to abandon this miserable curse of being alive and I will always 
double down on my beliefs till the end of time, **love is dead** and it might've never been alive in the first place,
you achievements will go unnoticed and when the star of our solar system decides to implode it will mean nothing, we will
all be gone and any trace of our presence will have never mattered, we are **Ozymandias**.
