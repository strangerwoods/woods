Entertain for a moment the idea that I'm not a schizo loser that has nothing good to say about humanity.  
What if I'm right and your little actions and emotions mean very little to anything and anyone, what then, 
what will you do? have you ever tried thinking for more than 5 minutes about it, the actions that other people
do, analyze them until you figure out **why** they did that fucking single thing, no matter how small or insignificant
their actions speak waves about them and what is going on in their mind their brain constantly adjusting twisting and turning
electrical impulses jumping like a mini supercomputer only to move an inch closer towards you trying to feel the
warm of another **piece of meat** next to them, their gaze adjusting to meet yours staring at you so deep you can
feel like you're gonna **piss yourself all over the fucking floor and strangle them to death with your belt**; only to stop and
wonder if this was meant to be through some higher deity or creature that controls you like little puppets with some shitty
ass strings (I gotta say).   

&nbsp;

It's been a uhh, pretty rough night and day I gotta say, my mind is going all over the place and I honestly just wish there
was someone else to tell me what to think, being a human is inexplicably hard. 

&nbsp;

I don't see you yet I know you, you've wandered long and hard around this obsessively painful world only to come to this,
nothingness spread on a sheet of text that has no end and no beginning, agonizing solace shall befall you.

&nbsp;

This is it for tonight, I'm exhausted and my energy for writing has run dry, love you all, hope you die, *good night*.
