This is my first post to this sort of blog I'm writing, I really don't know who or what it is for
I just feel like I need to write down what I'm thinking so I dont go insane from well, thinking too much.
Not belonging in this world is a feeling that has been far too common lately, I pray and pray and pray that
I might be wrong about how things are but I find myself coming to the same conclusion, this is not good enough
for me, I yearn for more than this place can offer, death seems like the solution to all this but I wonder if
nothingness will suit me, if it's what I want.

Tomorrow I have a therapy appointment, I struggle with saying what I feel because the days are starting to melt
into eachother, my life is a violently distorted mostrosity that I can't get out of, my hobbies my interest, my
pleasures I doubt on the daily trying to figure out what I'm made of and who I am in such a horribly human way 
that I despise from the bottom of my heart. My talents and my cognitive skills are nothing but smoke and mirrors.
I am so detached from the human experience that I feel nothing particular watching other people live their lives
it's more like observing mounds of flesh making sounds and moving but without nothing added to it, I fail to see 
them beyond confusing objects that hold no value beyond what they're able to give me.

Trying to analyze my own thoughts makes me high, nauseaous, makes me pace in my room feeling like I need to rip
off my skin and pass out on the ground in a pool of my own blood, even trying to make sense of what to write on 
this is such a disgusting feeling like I need to prove something to myself, this is it for today.
