I'm uhh, unable to sleep, every time I close my eyes at night it's like I'm dragged in a whole other world
a better one maybe but the fact that they're divided between day and night makes me feel like I'm going insane.
I'm listening to some synthwave(?) music and just writing stuff down trying to make sense of my mind and the things
I'd like to do, this is taking a lot of effort much more than I'm used to. I wish to not exist anymore and that's the only
truth I've ever known, ever since I was young and didn't wanna take part in family photos it was like I already knew what 
was gonna happen to me. I've recently taken a like to pinterest and collecting images from there to remind me of what I 
believe in and what makes me, me, it's such a girly website (usually) yet I enjoy the simple act of looking at things that 
look like myself.

I really don't like most people, the current idea is "autism" but I'm still pretty sure I dont have that, the more I think about
which mental illnesses I have the more they blend one into eachother becoming a garbled mess of me basically having "**everything everywhere
all at once**", it feels like my body wants to hit itself against a wall over and over and over again until it feels nothing no more.

I've been playing this game, space station 14, it's about roleplaying on a space ship and it's been such a timesink for me.
I get these springs of anger and rage inside of me but I'm not about to destroy the electronics that I have near me cause I 
paid a bunch for em.

I tried puffing on my dmt pen, the effects are pretty light but it does make me feel much more weightless, is this how normal people
feel all the time?

&nbsp;  

I feel like puking, I'm watching a video about the eightfold path trying to make sense of buddhism and my place in it.

&nbsp;  

How bad does writing have to get before you should be ashamed of it, I'm watching a video about a manga I read lately, "homunculus".
The struggles of people are really interesting, I wish to peer into the soul of someone until I understand every inch of them, every
movement they make I just want to know that there's someone out there who's just like fucking me and who enjoys the stuff that I do,
every connection I've made and that I will probably ever make feels so shallow, so lackluster every time there's a moment of silence
it sounds like it wasn't meant to be, we aren't meant to be having this conversation, I shouldn't be in this position you'll never understand
my point of view and even if you tried you would get it all wrong we'd be stuck on the same thing for ages because the human mind was 
not made for this, for not moving for staying still and quiet and trying to figure out the other person and trying to understand them.

&nbsp;  

Do you ever feel like a fraud? I do, pretty damn often, every time I take a shortcut I feel like I'm doing myself wrong and cheating and like
I'm not good enough because I never heard that said to me, because I never wanted to live as much as other people expected of me, because I never tried
enough in what I was supposed to be doing. Every word that I say or type feels incomplete, wrong not enough among the enormous amount of things I
have to say, every correction every mistake every fucking time I stutter it feels so wrong.

&nbsp;

I think this is enough from me, I need to go to sleep or I'll actually go insane, **Goodnight**.
