Tonight I'm not doing so well, I still struggle with being able to accept imperfections and being unsatisfied with everything I come
up with. My mind is all over the place, I have the abily to create anything, anything at all but my body just wont move, I feel trapped
in an endless cycle, every day feels the fucking same and I come up with goes into nothing, nothing at all. I hope I get out of it soon
I'm sorry for who I am.
