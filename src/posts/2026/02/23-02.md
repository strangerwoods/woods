Today I met someone I havent seen in a long time, she's smart n has a bright future ahead of her, I can't help but be
just a little jealous of it, it's like when you meet someone as broken as you and they suddenly turn their lives around
but you get left behind, stuck in the same cycle of misery and self loathing. The feeling of unfairness is there but there's
no one to blame except yourself for not being good enough. I felt wronged many times but I can't bear to hold any hatred in me
because it would make me rot from the inside.

Y'know maybe sometimes the past should be burned down to the ground, there's no home left there and if there was it would be in
shambles, falling apart at the slightest gust of wind. I loved and was loved but maybe neither is enough to make me happy, really happy I mean
something that is worth striving towards
